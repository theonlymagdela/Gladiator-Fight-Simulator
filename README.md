Subject: Ave Imperator, morituri te salutant!

Recently I've been really into Ancient Rome and Gladiator fights and stuff.
I've watched Spartacus and played Swords & Sandals for dozens of hours.
I think that we have some spare budget for a little inside-project,
so I would like to task you with creating a Gladiator Tournament simulator!
You will find the user stories and the details in the attachment below.

Oh, this guy again. Well, let's get to it!

In this project, your primary goal is to design and create logic behind
the Gladiator Tournament simulator. It means that the program is going
to work in the terminal at first, but later we would like to port it
to a GUI version. The main focus is on the object-oriented approach, 
and the separation of concerns.

## What are you going to learn?

- advanced OOP - abstraction, inheritance, interfaces, polymorphism and encapsulation
- practical usage of the Model-View-Controller design pattern
- a little bit of math ;)


## Tasks

1. Implement the `ConsoleView` class that will be used as the view module for the Colosseum. It must implement the `IView`/`Viewable` interface.
    - The 'display()' method makes a string be printed out to the terminal
    - The `getNumberBetween()` method uses the standard terminal input and loops until an acceptable (i.e. within the given inclusive bounds) input is provided by the user

2. Create a base class for all gladiator types, and four subclasses: Swordsman, Archer, Assassin, and Brutal.
    - There is a `Gladiator` abstract class that provides all necessary functionalities for all its subclasses
    - The `getFullName` method (or `fullName` property in C#) returns the full name of the gladiator assembled of his type and name (e.g. "Brutal Brutus", "Archer Leo")
    - The gladiators `level` can be incremented by invoking `levelUp` method, and accessed via `getLevel` method.
    - Within `Gladiator` class, there are three `protected` functions (properties in C#) returning multipliers for its HP, SP, and DEX statistics, respectively. The functions MUST then be implemented by every subclass of `Gladiator`.
    - Within `Gladiator` class, there are three public functions (properties in C#) returning the available values of the gladiator's statistics (HP, SP, and DEX, respectively). The available value is calculated by the following formula: `availableStatistic = baseStatistic × statisticMultiplier × level`
    - Every gladiator has a current health value. This is decreasing during a combat when receiving hits by the enemy. When this goes below zero, the gladiator dies.
    - There is a `Swordsman` subclass of `Gladiator`. Its multipliers are: HP: medium, SP: medium, DEX: medium
    - There is an `Archer` subclass of `Gladiator`. Its multipliers are: HP: medium, SP: medium, DEX: high
    - There is an `Assassin` subclass of `Gladiator`. Its multipliers are: HP: low, SP: high, DEX: high
    - There is a `Brutal` subclass of `Gladiator`. Its multipliers are: HP: high, SP: high, DEX: low

3. Implement the `GladiatorFactory` class for creating `Gladiator` instances
    - The `generateRandomGladiator` method randomly generates a new instance of one of the implemented subclasses of `Gladiator`. The `Swordsman` subclass is twice more likely to be created than any other subclass
    - HP, SP and DEX base statistics are assigned to a random value from range `[25-100]`, and LVL is assigned to a random value from range `[1-5]`
    - The static `Random` object from `RandomUtils` is used for randomization

4. Implement the `Combat` class for simulating duels between gladiators. The fighting mechanic is the same for all `Gladiator` subclasses. The combat simulation is turn based (A attacks B, then B attacks A, and so on).
    - The `Gladiator` class provides methods to be used in battle simulation:  `decreaseHpBy`, `isDead`, `healUp`, `getHp`, `getSp`, `getDex`, `getCurrentHp`
    - The `simulate` method runs the simulation of the whole fight. If any of the gladiators' current health becomes negative after an attack, the combat is finished, and the attacker is returned as the winner
    - If one of the opponents is null, the winner is the one that is not null. If both of the opponents are null, the return value is null
    - The first attacker is selected randomly, then the two gladiators take turns
    - During each turn, the attacker can either hit the enemy or miss. The chance of hit is calculated by the following method. Take the dexterity difference: `attackerDex - defenderDex` which must then be clamped (forced into the range `[10-100]`). For example:  attackerDex = 10; defenderDex = 120; -> attackerDex - defenderDex = -110; after clamping it is 10. The clamped value is the percentage chance of the attacker hitting the enemy
    - If the attacker hits the enemy, the damage reduced from the enemy's current health. The damage is calculated by integer value of the following formula: `damage = attackerSp × M` where `M` is a random number from range `[0.1-0.5]`
    - Combat class saves logs in a `List` that can be accessed via `getCombatLog` method.
    - If the attacker hits the enemy, the following log is persisted: `"X deals D damage"`, where `X` is the attacker's name and `D` is the damage
    - If the attacker misses, the following log is persisted: `"X missed"`, where `X` is the attacker's name
    - At the end of the combat, the following log is persisted: "X has died, Y wins!", where `X` and `Y` are the loser and winner gladiator's name, respectively
    - The static `Random` object from `RandomUtils` is used for randomization

5. Implement a `Tournament` class that will be used for arranging and invoking combats in the Colosseum `Tournament` will hold pair of contestants that will fight in it. If there are many pairs, they are being pushed down on this tree-like structure effectively expanding it. Check out this example: ```
    Julius
        |----____
    Petro       |
                |-----____
    Remus       |
        |----____
    Linus
``` We've created a Tournament with 2 pairs of contestants. After their fights are over, the winners make it to next round and fight witch each other. This will lead to identification of the best fighter.
    - The `Tournament` can be constructed both with one and multiple values
    - The `add()` and `addAll()` methods are used for adding new `Contestants` to the Tournament.
    - The `Tournament` is balanced - gladiators that make it to the final round should have same amount of fights behind them.

6. Implement the `Colosseum` class which serves as a main controller for the simulation. It generates participants, build a Tournament tree out of them, and executes the combats starting from the lowest level of the tree to get the final champion. During the simulation it communicates verbosely with the View.
    - The `generateGladiators()` method creates new gladiator instances using the `GladiatorFactory` provided in the constructor.
    - The `splitGladiatorsIntoPairs(gladiators)` method takes a list of gladiators and groups them in pairs that will fight during the Tournament.
    - The `simulateCombat` method executes a combat and logs the events to the View in the following form:
```
Duel Jupiter versus Nero:
 - Swordsman Jupiter (371/371 HP, 623 SP, 476 DEX, 7 LVL)
 - Brutal Nero (790/790 HP, 560 SP, 498 DEX, 8 LVL)
 - Jupiter missed, Nero deals 245 damage, Jupiter missed, Nero deals 183 damage
Swordsman Jupiter has died, Brutal Nero wins!
```

    - The winner of each combat has his level increased by one (which then affects his stats), then healed-up back to the available HP.
    - The `getChampion` method takes a `Tournament`, simulates a series of combats according to the fight hierarchy starting from the bottom, and returns the final winner as the champion.

7. [OPTIONAL] Instead of having `"X deals D damage"` and `X missed"` all the time (booooring), implement custom messages for each `Gladiator` subclass.
    - Every `Gladiator` subclass has its own set of custom messages for hitting and missing targets. The messages must contain the original references for the attacker's name and the amount of damage.

8. [OPTIONAL] Implement a "Kill or Spare" mechanic that allows loosing gladiators to survive and later fight in another Colosseum. There is no sparing in the second Colosseum.
    - At the end of each fight, the crowd randomly decides whether the loosing gladiator should be spared. The chance of being spared is 25%
    - After the end of the original event in the Colosseum the spared gladiators are put into a new tournament tree and have a second Tournament and a subsequent champion
    - There is no sparing in the second Colosseum

9. [OPTIONAL] Implement a weapon effect system that can cause additional damage or other advantages during combat.
    - Upon creation of a `Gladiator` there is a 10% chance that he will be granted with a special weapon effect. The effect is then randomly chosen from the ones mentioned below. The special weapon effects are displayed in the detailed view of the gladiator when announcing the combats
    - Bleeding - there is a 5% chance that upon receiving a hit, the enemy will start bleeding and will be receiving additional damage each turn (2% of his available HP per turn) until the end of the combat. There can be "multiple bleedings" at the same time with additive effects
    - Poison - there is a 20% chance that upon receiving a hit, the enemy gets poisoned and will be receiving additional damage for next 3 turns (5% of his available HP per turn). If poisoned again, the receiver immediately dies
    - Burning - there is a 15% chance that upon receiving a hit, the enemy is set on fire and will be receiving additional damage for a random amount of turns (in range `[1-5]`) (5% of his available HP per turn). If set on fire again, the duration of the burning is extended by a random amount of turns (in range `[1-5]`)
    - Paralyzing - there is a 10% chance that upon receiving a hit, the enemy is paralyzed which makes him unable to attack and to defend himself during the next 3 turns (so effectively skips 3 attacks and receives 3 hits for sure). If paralyzed again, the duration of the paralyzed state is reset to 3 turns
    - Using the weapon effect system you have implemented, create an effect of your own. Will it be freezing, magic, or something else? Be creative!
